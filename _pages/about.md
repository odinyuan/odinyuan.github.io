I am Yijun Yuan, a first year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh supervised by Dr. Balaji Palanisamy. My interest is in security and privacy issues in XR environment, and I aim to improve the usability of current XR applications as well as solve some privacy concerns from users' perspective. In particular, I think there are still many interesting questions when we are trying to migrate some of our settings on PC/mobile to XR context. At current stage, I am actively exploring the area I care about and reaching out to meet people that have similiar interests.

Before my PhD study, I earned my Master's degree in Information Science at University of Pittsburgh and my Bacholor's degree in Computer Science at Xiamen University.
